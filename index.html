The original version of the proposal document can be found here: https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html
The original document is an HTML version 4 document and included inline styling. 
I’ve edited the document, removing tags that are not supported with HTML5, added some new elements and attributes 
including a nav at the top of the page, and I moved most of the styling to a separate CSS document that’s linked above.

accelerators and experiments at CERN. It discusses the problems of loss of
information about complex evolving systems and derives a solution based on a
distributed hypertext system.</h3>

<h2 id = "overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Many of the discussions of the future at CERN and the LHC era end with the
question - Yes, but how will we ever keep track of such a large project?
This proposal provides an answer to such questions. Firstly, it discusses the
problem of information access at CERN. Then, it introduces the idea of linked
information systems, and compares them with less flexible ways of finding
information.</p>

<p>It then summarises my short experience with non-linear text systems known
as hypertext, describes what CERN needs from such a system, and what
industry may provide. Finally, it suggests steps we should take to involve
ourselves with hypertext now, so that individually and collectively we may
understand what we are creating.</p>
