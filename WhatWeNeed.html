    <h2 id = "requirements">CERN Requirements</h2>

<p>To be a practical system in the CERN environment, there are a number of
clear practical requirements.</p>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Remote access across networks.</h3></li>
    <ul><li>
        <p>CERN is distributed, and access from remote machines is essential.</p></li></ul>
    <li><h3>Heterogeneity</h3></li>
    <ul><li><p>Access is required to the same data from different types of system (VM/CMS,
        Macintosh, VAX/VMS, Unix)</p>  </li></ul>
    <li><h3>Non-Centralisation</h3></li>
    <ul><li><p>Information systems start small and grow. They also start isolated and then
        merge. A new system must allow existing systems to be linked together without
        requiring any central control or coordination.</p>   </li></ul>
    <li><h3>Access to existing data</h3></li>
    <ul><li><p>If we provide access to existing databases as though they were in hypertext
        form, the system will get off the ground quicker. This is discussed further
        below.</p>   </li></ul>
    <li><h3>Private links</h3></li>
    <ul><li>
        <p>One must be able to add one's own private links to and from public
        information. One must also be able to annotate links, as well as nodes,
        privately.</p>   </li></ul>
    <li><h3>Bells and Whistles</h3></li>
    <ul><li> <p>Storage of ASCII text, and display on 24x80 screens, is in the short term
        sufficient, and essential. Addition of graphics would be an optional extra
        with very much less penetration for the moment.</p>  </li></ul>
        <li> <h3>Data analysis</h3></li>
        <ul><li><p>An intriguing possibility, given a large hypertext database with typed
            links, is that it allows some degree of automatic analysis. It is possible to
            search, for example, for anomalies such as undocumented software or divisions
            which contain no people. It is possible to generate lists of people or devices
            for other purposes, such as mailing lists of people to be informed of changes.
            It is also possible to look at the topology of an organisation or a project,
            and draw conclusions about how it should be managed, and how it could evolve.
            This is particularly useful when the database becomes very large, and groups
            of projects, for example, so interwoven as to make it difficult to see the
            wood for the trees.</p>
            
            <p>In a complex place like CERN, it's not always obvious how to divide people
            into groups. Imagine making a large three-dimensional model, with people
            represented by little spheres, and strings between people who have something
            in common at work.</p>
            
            <p>Now imagine picking up the structure and shaking it, until you make some
            sense of the tangle: perhaps, you see tightly knit groups in some places, and
            in some places weak areas of communication spanned by only a few people.
            Perhaps a linked information system will allow us to see the real structure of
            the organisation in which we work.</p></li></ul>
        <li><h3>Live links</h3> </li>
        <ul><li><p>The data to which a link (or a hot spot) refers may be very static, or it
            may be temporary. In many cases at CERN information about the state of systems
            is changing all the time. Hypertext allows documents to be linked into "live"
            data so that every time the link is followed, the information is retrieved. If
            one sacrifices portability, it is possible so make following a link fire up a
            special application, so that diagnostic programs, for example, could be linked
            directly into the maintenance guide.</p></li></ul>
        <li><h3>Non requirements</h3> </li>
        <ul><li><p>Discussions on Hypertext have sometimes tackled the problem of copyright
            enforcement and data security. These are of secondary importance at CERN,
            where information exchange is still more important than secrecy. Authorisation
            and accounting systems for hypertext could conceivably be designed which are
            very sophisticated, but they are not proposed here.</p>
            
            <p>In cases where reference must be made to data which is in fact protected,
            existing file protection systems should be sufficient.</p></li></ul>
</ol>

<h2>Specific Applications</h2>

<p>The following are three examples of specific places in which the proposed
system would be immediately useful. There are many others.</p>
<div id="seg"><h3>Development Project Documentation.</h3>

    <p>The Remote procedure Call project has a skeleton description using Enquire.
    Although limited, it is very useful for recording who did what, where they
    are, what documents exist, etc. Also, one can keep track of users, and can
    easily append any extra little bits of information which come to hand and have
    nowhere else to be put. Cross-links to other projects, and to databases which
    contain information on people and documents would be very useful, and save
    duplication of information.</p></div>
<div id="seg"><h3>Document retrieval.</h3>

    <p>The CERNDOC system provides the mechanics of storing and printing
    documents. A linked system would allow one to browse through concepts,
    documents, systems and authors, also allowing references between documents to
    be stored. (Once a document had been found, the existing machinery could be
    invoked to print it or display it).</p></div>
<div id="seg"><h3>The "Personal Skills Inventory".</h3>

    <p>Personal skills and experience are just the sort of thing which need
    hypertext flexibility. People can be linked to projects they have worked on,
    which in turn can be linked to particular machines, programming languages,
    etc.</p></div>
<div class="clear"></div>







<h2>The State of the Art in Hypermedia</h2>

<p>An increasing amount of work is being done into hypermedia research at
universities and commercial research labs, and some commercial systems have
resulted. There have been two conferences, Hypertext '87 and '88, and in
Washington DC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NST) hosted
a workshop on standardisation in hypertext, a followup of which will occur
during 1990.</p>

<p>The Communications of the ACM special issue on Hypertext contains many
references to hypertext papers. A bibliography on hypertext is given in
[NIST90], and a uucp newsgroup alt.hypertext exists. I do not, therefore, give
a list here.</p>

<h3>Browsing techniques</h3>

<p>Much of the academic research is into the human interface side of browsing
through a complex information space. Problems addressed are those of making
navigation easy, and avoiding a feeling of being "lost in hyperspace". Whilst
the results of the research are interesting, many users at CERN will be
accessing the system using primitive terminals, and so advanced window styles
are not so important for us now.</p>

<h3>Interconnection or publication?</h3>

<p>Most systems available today use a single database. This is accessed by
many users by using a distributed file system. There are few products which
take Ted Nelson's idea of a wide "docuverse" literally by allowing links
between nodes in different databases. In order to do this, some
standardisation would be necessary. However, at the standardisation workshop,
the emphasis was on standardisation of the format for exchangeable media, nor
for networking. This is prompted by the strong push toward publishing of
hypermedia information, for example on optical disk. There seems to be a
general consensus about the abstract data model which a hypertext system
should use.</p>

<p>Many systems have been put together with little or no regard for
portability, unfortunately. Some others, although published, are proprietary
software which is not for external release. However, there are several
interesting projects and more are appearing all the time. Digital's "Compound
Document Architecture" (CDA) , for example, is a data model which may be
extendible into a hypermedia model, and there are rumours that this is a way
Digital would like to go.</p>

<h3>Incentives and CALS</h3>

<p>The US Department of Defence has given a big incentive to hypermedia
research by, in effect, specifying hypermedia documentation for future
procurement. This means that all manuals for parts for defence equipment must
be provided in hypermedia form. The acronym CALS stands for Computer-aided
Acquisition and Logistic Support).</p>

<p>There is also much support from the publishing industry, and from
librarians whose job it is to organise information.</p>

<h3>What will the system look like?</h3>

<p>Let us see what components a hypertext system at CERN must have. The only
way in which sufficient flexibility can be incorporated is to separate the
information storage software from the information display software, with a
well defined interface between them. Given the requirement for network access,
it is natural to let this clean interface coincide with the physical division
between the user and the remote database machine.</p>

<p>This division also is important in order to allow the heterogeneity which
is required at CERN (and would be a boon for the world in general).</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Fig 2. A client/server model for a distributed hypertext
system.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Therefore, an important phase in the design of the system is to define this
interface. After that, the development of various forms of display program and
of database server can proceed in parallel. This will have been done well if
many different information sources, past, present and future, can be mapped
onto the definition, and if many different human interface programs can be
written over the years to take advantage of new technology and standards.</p>

<h2 id = "accessingExistingData">Accessing Existing Data</h2>

<p>The system must achieve a critical usefulness early on. Existing hypertext
systems have had to justify themselves solely on new data. If, however, there
was an existing base of data of personnel, for example, to which new data
could be linked, the value of each new piece of data would be greater.</p>

<p>What is required is a gateway program which will map an existing structure
onto the hypertext model, and allow limited (perhaps read-only) access to it.
This takes the form of a hypertext server written to provide existing
information in a form matching the standard interface. One would not imagine
the server actually generating a hypertext database from and existing one:
rather, it would generate a hypertext view of an existing database.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/Image3.gif" alt="path between the database, the server and the browser">
<figcaption>Fig 3. A hypertext gateway allows existing data to be seen in hypertext
form by a hypertext browser.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some examples of systems which could be connected in this way are</p>
<dl>
  <dt>uucp News</dt>
    <dd>This is a Unix electronic conferencing system. A server for uucp news
      could makes links between notes on the same subject, as well as showing
      the structure of the conferences.</dd>
  <dt>VAX/Notes</dt>
    <dd>This is Digital's electronic conferencing system. It has a fairly wide
      following in FermiLab, but much less in CERN. The topology of a
      conference is quite restricting.</dd>
  <dt>CERNDOC</dt>
    <dd>This is a document registration and distribution system running on
      CERN's VM machine. As well as documents, categories and projects,
      keywords and authors lend themselves to representation as hypertext
      nodes.</dd>
  <dt>File systems</dt>
    <dd>This would allow any file to be linked to from other hypertext
      documents.</dd>
  <dt>The Telephone Book</dt>
    <dd>Even this could even be viewed as hypertext, with links between people
      and sections, sections and groups, people and floors of buildings,
    etc.</dd>
  <dt>The unix manual</dt>
    <dd>This is a large body of computer-readable text, currently organised in
      a flat way, but which also contains link information in a standard
      format ("See also..").</dd>
  <dt>Databases</dt>
    <dd>A generic tool could perhaps be made to allow any database which uses
      a commercial DBMS to be displayed as a hypertext view.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In some cases, writing these servers would mean unscrambling or obtaining
details of the existing protocols and/or file formats. It may not be practical
to provide the full functionality of the original system through hypertext. In
general, it will be more important to allow read access to the general public:
it may be that there is a limited number of people who are providing the
information, and that they are content to use the existing facilities.</p>

<p>It is sometimes possible to enhance an existing storage system by coding
hypertext information in, if one knows that a server will be generating a
hypertext representation. In 'news' articles, for example, one could use (in
the text) a standard format for a reference to another article. This would be
picked out by the hypertext gateway and used to generate a link to that note.
This sort of enhancement will allow greater integration between old and new
systems.</p>

<p>There will always be a large number of information management systems - we
get a lot of added usefulness from being able to cross-link them. However, we
will lose out if we try to constrain them, as we will exclude systems and
hamper the evolution of hypertext in general.</p>
